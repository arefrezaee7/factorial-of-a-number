# factorial-of-a-number
this is an assingment from university 
so i wanted to do the algorithm in the flowgorithm app instead of just writing it on a peace of paper 
after a few trial and error in the process
i made it work and im gonna explain the process blow:
  1.i wrote three variables 
                    the first was "num" 
                    the second was "snum"(which stands for second number)
                    the third was "ans"  (which is the answer)
                     p.s. they are  int
  2.then i gave snum and ans the value of one for further calculation purposes
  3.then i took a int type input from the user and put it in num
  4.then i created a conditional while loop and the condition was that if snum <= num   which means that if the input num is bigger or equal to snum which is ..1...
  if false then the asnwer will be printed  if else:
  it will take the ans and snum and multiply them together and put them in ans (now this equasion is kind of useless in the first loop becuse the value of both of them is 1 but after that the algorithm will add on to it and make thing work ;)  )
  and after that it will add one to snum and it will run it trough the loop until the condition of the loop is met and the value of snum is smaller or equal to num (the input)
 and then it will print out the answer
 
with thanks to you who read this far..
